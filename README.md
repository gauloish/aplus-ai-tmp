## Installation
Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.13 installed on your system.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**.  
You can also use other APIS like GROQ

- Modify `src/crew_test/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/crew_test/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/crew_test/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/crew_test/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project
You can set you question and correct answer in the `src/main.py` file and then run.

```bash
$ crewai run
```

## Results
The tips generated by your crew will be in the `teacher.md` and the `appraiser.md` files.
If you want to save the result somewhere else, you can use the `ans` variable in the `src/main.py`file
